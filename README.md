# Kubernetes

## üî∑ Part 1: What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system used to automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### üîπ Why Kubernetes?
Docker runs 1 container well, but managing 100s or 1000s? That‚Äôs hard.

Kubernetes helps you manage containers across many servers, restart failed apps, scale easily, and more.

### üîπ Basic Kubernetes Components (Simple Overview)
Component                                    Description
Pod	                          Smallest unit in K8s, holds 1 or more containers
Node	                        A machine (VM or physical) that runs Pods
Cluster	                      Group of nodes managed by Kubernetes
Deployment                   	Manages multiple replicas of a Pod
Service	                      xposes Pods to internal or external traffic
Namespace	                    Separates different environments (like dev, prod)
ConfigMap & Secret	          Used to inject config values & secrets into Pods

## üî∏ Real-World Kubernetes Interview Questions & Answers
### Q1. What is a Pod in Kubernetes?
Answer:
A pod is the smallest unit in Kubernetes. It contains one or more containers that share storage, network, and a spec. If a pod dies, a new one is created by the Deployment or ReplicaSet.

### Q2. What is the difference between a Pod and a Deployment?
Pod	                           Deployment
Manages 1 unit	           Manages multiple pods
No auto-restart	           Handles auto-restart
Not ideal for production	Suitable for production workloads

### Q3. How do you expose your application to the internet?
Answer:
We create a Service of type LoadBalancer or NodePort. In production, we use Ingress controllers for routing and TLS termination.

### Q4. How do you perform rolling updates?
Answer:
Kubernetes Deployments support rolling updates by default. When you change the image version, it gradually updates pods one by one without downtime.

```
kubectl set image deployment/web-deployment nginx=nginx:1.21
```
### Q5. What is a ConfigMap and Secret?
Answer:

ConfigMap stores non-sensitive key-value data.

Secret stores encrypted sensitive data (like DB passwords).

Both are injected into Pods as environment variables or volumes.

### Q6. How do you check the logs of a pod?
```
kubectl logs pod-name
```
üîπ If multiple containers:

```
kubectl logs pod-name -c container-name
```
### Q7. How do you scale your application?
```
kubectl scale deployment web-deployment --replicas=5
```
### Q8. How do you monitor Kubernetes?
Answer:

Use Prometheus + Grafana for metrics

Use tools like Datadog, NewRelic, or ELK stack for logging

kubectl top shows resource usage

### Q9. How does Kubernetes handle self-healing?
Answer:
If a Pod crashes, the Deployment or ReplicaSet automatically starts a new one. If a Node goes down, pods are rescheduled on another node.

### Q10. What challenges have you faced with Kubernetes?
Answer:

Config drift ‚Üí Fixed using GitOps

Service discovery issues ‚Üí Used DNS and labels properly

Scaling problems ‚Üí Implemented Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

Debugging ‚Üí Used kubectl describe, logs, and probes (readiness/liveness)

## üî∑ Part 2: Intermediate to Advanced Kubernetes Concepts
### ‚úÖ 1. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
What it does:
It automatically increases or decreases the number of pods based on CPU/memory usage or custom metrics.

Example:

```
kubectl autoscale deployment web-deployment --cpu-percent=50 --min=2 --max=5
```
‚è© Means: If CPU goes above 50%, Kubernetes can scale pods between 2 and 5.

Why it matters in interviews:
Shows you understand how to save costs and handle traffic spikes.

### ‚úÖ 2. Readiness and Liveness Probes
These check if your app is healthy and ready to accept traffic.

Readiness Probe = "Can the app take traffic?"

Liveness Probe = "Is the app still alive or stuck?"

YAML Example:

```
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 3
```
### ‚úÖ 3. Helm Charts (Package Manager for Kubernetes)
Helm is like YUM or APT for Kubernetes. It helps you install apps using templates.

Use case:
Instead of writing multiple YAML files, use Helm charts to manage apps like NGINX, Prometheus, Jenkins.

Install example:

```
helm install my-nginx bitnami/nginx
```
Interview tip:
Say: "We used Helm for reusable templates and version control of Kubernetes resources."

### ‚úÖ 4. StatefulSet vs Deployment
Feature	                      Deployment	               StatefulSet
Pod names	                     Random	                     Fixed (web-0, web-1)
Storage                   	Shared/ephemeral	         Persistent, stable
Use case	                  Stateless apps	           Databases (MySQL, etc)

üß† Interview answer:
If your app needs stable storage or ordered start (like DBs), use StatefulSet.

### ‚úÖ 5. DaemonSet
Runs one pod per node (or more if needed).

Use case: Logging agent, monitoring agent, etc.

```
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: log-agent
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: log-agent
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: log-agent
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: filebeat
        image: elastic/filebeat
```
### ‚úÖ 6. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
Controls who can do what in a cluster.

Example:

```
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: dev
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```
Then bind with a user/service account using RoleBinding.

üß† Interview line:
"We use RBAC to separate access between developers and admins in dev/staging/prod clusters."

### ‚úÖ 7. NetworkPolicy
Controls which pods can talk to each other. By default, all pods can communicate.

Example:

```
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-app
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: backend
```
üß† Use case: "Only frontend should access backend, others denied."

### ‚úÖ 8. Namespaces
Used to separate environments (like dev, test, prod).

```
kubectl create namespace dev
kubectl get pods -n dev
```
üß† Interview answer:
"We used namespaces to isolate teams and workloads across the same cluster."

## üß† Real-World Kubernetes Interview Questions (Advanced)
### Q11. What is the difference between ConfigMap and Secret?
Answer:
ConfigMap = plain text
Secret = base64 encoded (for sensitive info)
Both can be injected into Pods.

### Q12. How do you manage app upgrades in Kubernetes?
Answer:

Use rolling updates in Deployments.

Use Helm to version control and rollback if needed.

Example: ``` helm upgrade app-name new-version ```

### Q13. What are the ways to monitor a Kubernetes cluster?
Answer:

``` kubectl top ``` ‚Äì for basic CPU/Memory

Prometheus + Grafana ‚Äì full metrics

ELK Stack ‚Äì logs

Datadog, New Relic, or Dynatrace ‚Äì cloud monitoring

### Q14. How do you debug a Kubernetes issue?
Steps:

``` kubectl describe pod pod-name ```

``` kubectl logs pod-name ```

Check events section

Look into probes, image pull errors, or service mapping

### Q15. How do you roll back to a previous version?
```
kubectl rollout undo deployment my-deployment
```
Or with Helm:

```
helm rollback release-name version
```

## üî∑ Kubernetes Part 3 ‚Äì Deployment Strategies, Troubleshooting & Scenarios
### ‚úÖ 1. Rolling Update
Default strategy in Kubernetes.
It updates pods gradually with zero downtime.

How it works:

Takes old pods down one by one

Brings up new pods step by step

```
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 1
    maxSurge: 1
```
üß† Used when: No downtime is acceptable, and app supports gradual upgrade.

### ‚úÖ 2. Blue-Green Deployment
You have two environments: Blue (old) and Green (new).
Traffic is switched to Green after successful deployment.

Kubernetes trick:
Use two services or label selectors, and change service selector to new pods.

üß† Used when: You need fast rollback and testing the new version before exposing.

### ‚úÖ 3. Canary Deployment
Release the new version to a small percentage of users first.
If all goes well, increase rollout to 100%.

How it‚Äôs done:

Use multiple Deployments

Adjust weights using Ingress or Service mesh like Istio/Linkerd

üß† Good for: Testing new features on real traffic with low risk.

### ‚úÖ 4. Kubernetes Troubleshooting Steps
üîπ a. Pod CrashLoopBackOff
```
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```
Check app logs

Check health probes

Check ConfigMap or Secret issues

üîπ b. ImagePullBackOff
Wrong image name or registry permissions

Fix image name or use secret for private registry

üîπ c. Pending Pods
No resources available on nodes

Use ``` kubectl describe ``` to see scheduler errors

### ‚úÖ 5. Service Types in Kubernetes
Type	                         Purpose
ClusterIP	              Default, internal communication only
NodePort	              Expose service on a static port
LoadBalancer	          For external traffic (like AWS ELB)
ExternalName          	Map service to external DNS

üß† Tip: "For internal communication, we used ClusterIP. For user access, we used LoadBalancer on AWS."

### ‚úÖ 6. Ingress Controller
Manages external access (HTTP/HTTPS) to services.

YAML Example:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: demo-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: demo.myapp.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: demo-service
            port:
              number: 80
```
üß† Used for: Exposing multiple apps using a single LoadBalancer.

### ‚úÖ 7. Kubernetes YAML Breakdown (Basic)
Pod YAML

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nginx

      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
```
## üß† Real Interview Scenario Questions
### Q16. What happens if a node dies in Kubernetes?
Answer:
Kubernetes automatically reschedules the pods to another available node using the scheduler.

### Q17. How do you ensure a pod always runs on a specific node?
Answer: Use nodeSelector, nodeAffinity, or taints and tolerations.

### Q18. How do you handle secrets in Kubernetes?
Answer:

Use Secret object (base64 encoded)

Use external tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager for more security

### Q19. How do you upgrade Kubernetes in production?
Answer:

Upgrade control plane first

Then upgrade worker nodes one by one (cordon ‚Üí drain ‚Üí upgrade)

### Q20. How do you reduce cost in Kubernetes?
Answer:

Use HPA to auto-scale pods

Use cluster auto-scaler to scale nodes

Use Spot Instances/Node Pools

Clean up unused resources
